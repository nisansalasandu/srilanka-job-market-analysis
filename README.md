// Year-over-Year Growth
YoY Growth % = 
VAR CurrentYear = [Total Revenue]
VAR PreviousYear = 
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Revenue[Date]))
RETURN
    DIVIDE(CurrentYear - PreviousYear, PreviousYear, 0) * 100

// 3-Month Moving Average
3M Moving Avg = 
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(Revenue[Date], LASTDATE(Revenue[Date]), -3, MONTH),
    [Total Revenue]
